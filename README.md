This was the first project I ever did and really ignited my passion for coding. It is a simple space invaders clone that I created well following along with a tutorial. It was particully special to me as I felt like I made everything myself from scratch and really understood every line of code i wrote. One day, when I find a spare weekend I would like to make this project again from scatch and make it completly my own.
