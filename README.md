## Space Invaders Clone

This was the first project I ever completed, and it truly ignited my passion for coding. It's a simple Space Invaders clone that I built while following along with a tutorial.

What made it particularly special to me was the sense of ownership I feltâ€”I understood every line of code and it felt like I was building something from scratch. It was a turning point that deepened my interest in programming.

One day, when I find a spare weekend, I'd love to recreate this project entirely from scratch and make it completely my own.
